# Quantum Gate Package

## Overview

This project implements a lightweight quantum simulation framework for constructing and applying **quantum gate operators** on an **n-qubit register**.  
It supports both **state-vector** and **density-matrix** representations of quantum states.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate correct operator construction, proper qubit indexing, and test-driven validation of quantum operations.
